        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Pulse oximeters are non-invasive medical devices widely used to measure the oxygen saturation level (SpO₂) of a patient's blood, providing critical information about respiratory and cardiovascular health. This article guides you in making your own Arduino-based pulse oximeter. Although it would be much easier and more efficient to purchase one from an online retailer or your nearest medical store, building a pulse oximeter by yourself marks a great learning experience. This article also tells you about the functioning and significance of these devices along with an introduction to the use of Arduino and its relevance in teaching students and enthusiasts about electronics. This article will guide you to use a web-based interface to display the readings from your pulse oximeter, and finally, an overview of other projects related to the biomedical field that can be created. <strong>Please note that this website is only for educational purposes.</strong>

    <section id="why">
        <h2>Why Build Your Own Pulse Oximeter?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Naturally this question was supposed to arise as to why even consider making a pulse oximeter in the first place. The answer to that question is simple; by creating this project you get a chance to learn about biology, electronics and programming at the same time. It doesn’t necessarily matter which age group you belong to but if you are a high school student right now this article might be helpful to you for a school project. You might be looking for a fun little electronics project or you are simply here as an enthusiast. Regardless of the purpose by the end of this article, you’ll have a pulse oximeter at your home if you correctly follow the given instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another neat reason to create this project is that this project is a great first step towards learning about robotics in the future. Yes, you read that correctly! An Arduino is still an integral part of major robotics projects. Arduino can be used in robotics projects for tasks like controlling motors, sensors, and actuators. It helps build robots that can move, sense the environment, avoid obstacles, follow lines, or even interact with users.
            </li>
            <li>
                But I know some of you might be scratching your head right now and asking what exactly an Arduino is. The answer to that lies in the next section.

        <h2>Arduino- An overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that combines easy-to-use hardware and software, designed for people of all skill levels. At its core, Arduino boards are small, programmable microcontrollers that can control and interact with various electronic components like sensors, motors, and LEDs. Users write code in the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create projects ranging from simple gadgets to complex systems. Arduino is popular for DIY electronics, robotics, and automation projects because it’s beginner-friendly, affordable, and well-supported by a large community.

    <!-- Understanding Readings -->
    <section id="understand-readings">
        <h2>Understanding the Pulse Oximeter Readings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂):</strong> SpO₂ is the percentage of haemoglobin molecules in the blood that are saturated with oxygen. The normal range for SpO₂ levels is typically from 95% to 100% in healthy individuals (Hess, 2016).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Haemoglobin and Light Absorption:</strong> Haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for oxygen transport, has different light absorption characteristics depending on whether it is oxygenated (oxyhaemoglobin) or deoxygenated (deoxyhaemoglobin). Pulse oximeters exploit these differences to determine SpO₂ (Sun & Thakor, 2016).
            </li>

    <!--Working-->
    <section id="working">
        <h2>Working of a Pulse Oximeter</h2>
        <p>
            The working of a standard pulse oximeter can be understood from its components. It consists of three main parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Light Emitters:</strong> Typically, two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light at specific wavelengths—commonly red (around 660 nm) and infrared (around 940 nm). These wavelengths are chosen because of their differential absorption by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (Tamura, 2019).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Photodetector:</strong> Positioned adjacent to the emitters, the photodetector captures the light that passes through or is reflected by the blood vessels in the tissue (commonly the fingertip, earlobe, or other peripheral sites) (Tamura, 2019).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Microprocessor:</strong> This component analyzes the detected light signals, processes the data, and calculates the SpO₂ value, which is then displayed to the user.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="resources/components.jpg" alt="components">

    </section>
    <!-- Clinical Significance -->
    <section id="clinical">
        <h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Newborn Screening for CCHD:</strong> Pulse oximetry has been suggested as a newborn screening method for identifying critical congenital heart disease (CCHD), which refers to heart defects that necessitate surgery or catheter-based intervention within the first year of life. Since many newborns with CCHD experience some level of hypoxemia early on, pulse oximetry is recommended as a screening tool to detect neonatal CCHD before hospital discharge, even before symptoms appear (Nitzan et al., 2014).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>COVID-19 Pandemic:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of remote health monitoring tools, with pulse oximeters emerging as vital devices for both patients and healthcare providers. COVID-19 can cause significant respiratory issues, including hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), which may not always present with noticeable symptoms. Pulse oximeters enable early detection of declining oxygen saturation, allowing for timely medical intervention (Bickler et al., 2021; Luks & Swenson, 2020).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</strong> COPD is a progressive lung disease that impairs breathing. Regular tracking of oxygen saturation helps manage the chronic nature of COPD, ensuring that patients maintain adequate oxygen levels throughout daily activities (Schermer et al., 2009).
